0.1.0 (2021-12-28)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
* Based on draft version of the RFC.

1.0.0-alpha (2025-02-09)
------------------------

* Based on final version of the RFC.
* This necessitated a breaking change to the layout of the UUID bit fields.
  * Note UUIDv7s generated by v0.1.0 are larger than new UUIDv7s generated by this version. 
  * So monotonicity is NOT maintained across versions!
* Switched from polymorphic `uuid7(as_type='str')` style functions to the simpler `uuid7_str()`.
* Supports Python typing, per PEP561.
* Includes an `id25` format that is a 25-character string representation of the UUID7. I often use these when my objects contain some UUIDv4 and it is hard to tell at a glance whether a collection of UUIDs are all v7 or not. 
* Incorporates feedback from GitHub issues and PRs.
